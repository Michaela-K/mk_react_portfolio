            I knew I loved code when I spontaneously joined a 
            <span className="text-highlight"> very intense</span>
            , 20 day bootcamp in 2020. Called "ALL ABOARD bootcamp", it was
            focused on Ruby & Rails and was held by the oh so generous John
            Crepezzi, who was at that time, Github's Principal Engineer.

            Knowing absolutely ZERO about what coding was, I
            <span className="text-highlight"> COMPLETELY FAILED </span>
            it, but enjoyed every last minute of the struggle !!

            I loved seeing what code could do, the logic behind it, the
            challenge of it and the pore raising satisfaction when I was able to
            fix bugs in the code.
          </p>
          <p className="about__section-description">
            After that, I immediately dove right back in, teaching myself HTML,
            CSS and JavaScript, by taking part in the #100daysofcodechallenge on
            Twitter, before joining and successfully completing LightHouse Labs'
            Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp in 2022.

            Since then I continue to practice what I've learnt and add new
            technologies to my repertoire.
